Kamote Racer 2D
A fast-paced,casual,nostalgic, retro-styled 2D racing game that revives classic arcade fun for the modern era. Dodge sweet potato traffic, rack up score, and see how long you can survive on the endless journey.
The objective is straightforward: survive as long as possible while avoiding kamote obstacles that appear randomly and increase in speed as the game progresses. Players earn points based on the distance traveled or time survived.    

Instructions:

*Players can customize their racer before starting the game.
  
   * Use your mouse or trackpad to drag and drop different color options onto the car.

  * Pick your preferred color or style to make your racer stand out on the road.

 *The main goal is to survive as long as you can—if you hit even one kamote, it’s instant Game Over.

 * Control your racer by moving left and right to dodge the silly, fast-moving kamote obstacles on the road.
*If using a mouse or trackpad, you can control the racer in two ways:

*Move your cursor left or right, and the racer will follow your horizontal movement.

*Click and drag the racer left or right using your mouse or trackpad for more precise control.

*Once you’re happy with your design, click Start to begin the game.
